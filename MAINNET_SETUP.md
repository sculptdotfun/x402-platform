   - MetaMask, Phantom, Coinbase Wallet, etc.

## üö® Security

- Never share your CDP API keys
- Use a separate wallet for receiving payments
- Monitor transactions regularly
- Consider rate limiting in production

That's it! No complex setup, no testnet confusion. Just mainnet from day one. üéâ
